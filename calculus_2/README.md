# Computational Mathematics: Calculus 2 (Python with SageMath)

This folder contains my self-study projects and implementations focused on advanced integration techniques and the fundamentals of sequences and series, as covered in Calculus 2. All code is implemented exclusively in Python using SageMath.

## Topics Covered:

* **Lesson Ten:** `integration_by_parts.py` - Techniques for integrating products of functions.
* **Lesson Eleven:** `trigonometric_integrals.py` - Methods for integrating powers and products of trigonometric functions.
* **Lesson Twelve:** `integration_by_trigonometric_substitution.py` - Using trigonometric substitutions to simplify and solve integrals.
* **Lesson Thirteen:** `integration_by_partial_fractions.py` - Decomposing rational functions into simpler fractions for integration.
* **Lesson Fifteen:** `improper_integrals.py` - Evaluating integrals with infinite limits or discontinuous integrands.
* **Lesson Sixteen:** `sequences_and_limits.py` - Understanding the behavior of sequences and their limits.
* **Lesson Seventeen:** `infinite_series_geometric_series.py` - Introduction to infinite series, with a focus on geometric series.
* **Lesson Twenty-Two:** `the_ratio_and_root_tests.py` - Applying the ratio and root tests to determine the convergence or divergence of series.
* **Lesson Twenty-Three:** `taylor_polynomials_and_approximations.py` - Constructing and using Taylor polynomials for function approximations.
* **Lesson Twenty-Four:** `power_series_and_intervals_of_convergence.py` - Exploring power series and determining their intervals of convergence.

## Purpose:

These notebooks and scripts are designed to:
* Deepen my theoretical understanding of core Calculus 2 concepts.
* Develop practical computational skills for applying calculus in mathematical modeling using Python and SageMath.
* Illustrate numerical and symbolic aspects of calculus.

## Technologies Used:

* **Python:** All implementations use Python, primarily leveraging:
    * `SageMath`: Utilizing `from sage.all import *` for powerful symbolic computation, numerical analysis, and visualization capabilities.

## How to Navigate This Folder:

Each script or notebook is organized by topic, demonstrating the concepts and their computational implementation in Python with SageMath. You will find code examples, detailed explanations, and practical applications.
