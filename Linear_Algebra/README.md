# Computational Mathematics: Linear Algebra (Julia)

This folder contains my self-study projects and implementations focused on Linear Algebra, with an emphasis on detailed understanding and the application of mathematical models. All code is implemented exclusively in Julia.

## Topics Covered:

* [cite_start]**Linear Transformations:** Exploring the concept of linear transformations and how they are represented and applied[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Systems of Linear Equations:** Methods for solving systems of linear equations and their significance in various applications[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Bases: Basic Building Blocks:** Understanding bases as fundamental building blocks for vector spaces and their role in linear algebra[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Determinants: Numbers That Say a Lot:** Delving into determinants and what these single numbers reveal about a matrix and its transformations[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Eigenstuff: Revealing Hidden Structure:** An introduction to eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and their ability to uncover intrinsic properties of matrices[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues: Geometry:** Geometric interpretations and applications of eigenvectors and eigenvalues[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Population Dynamics: Foxes and Rabbits:** Applying linear algebra, particularly eigenvalues and eigenvectors, to model real-world phenomena like population changes[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Differential Equations: New Applications:** How linear algebra provides tools for solving and understanding systems of differential equations[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Markov Chains: Hopping Around:** Exploring Markov chains and their utility in modeling systems that evolve probabilistically over time[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Multilinear Regression: Least Squares:** The application of linear algebra in statistics, specifically in understanding multilinear regression and the least squares method[cite: 1].

## Purpose:

These notebooks and scripts are designed to:
* Deepen my theoretical understanding of core linear algebra concepts.
* Develop practical computational skills for applying linear algebra in mathematical modeling using Julia.
* Illustrate the numerical and symbolic aspects of linear algebra.

## Technologies Used:

* **Julia:** All implementations use Julia, leveraging packages such as:
    * `LinearAlgebra.jl`: For core matrix and vector operations.
    * `Oscar.jl`: For symbolic computations and algebraic geometry.
    * `SciML Symbolics.jl`: For symbolic manipulation and scientific machine learning applications.
    * `Plots.jl`: For data visualization.

## How to Navigate This Folder:

Each subfolder or notebook is typically organized by topic, demonstrating the concepts and their computational implementation in Julia. You will find code examples, detailed explanations, and practical applications.
