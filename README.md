# Computational_Mathematics

This repository showcases a personal self-study journey into **Computational Mathematics**, focusing on Calculus, Linear Algebra, Numerical, and Symbolic Computing.

A unique aspect of this collection, particularly within the Calculus notebooks, is its foundational reliance on **Abstract Algebra**. Many of the concepts are explored and implemented using the **Oscar.jl** framework in Julia, which is built upon powerful algebraic systems like AbstractAlgebra.jl and Nemo.jl. This unconventional approach, applying advanced algebraic structures to traditional calculus problems, was a challenging yet highly rewarding endeavor, leading to a deeper understanding of underlying mathematical principles.

Implementations are primarily in **Julia** (leveraging Oscar.jl and the SciML ecosystem's Symbolics.jl for dedicated symbolic calculus where appropriate), **Python** (utilizing SageMath for its comprehensive capabilities), and **R**.

Each notebook illustrates core mathematical concepts through hands-on code examples.
