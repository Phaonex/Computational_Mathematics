This folder contains my self-study projects and implementations focused on fundamental concepts of Calculus 1, emphasizing detailed understanding and practical application of mathematical models. All code is implemented exclusively in Julia.

## Topics Covered:

* **Lesson Four:** `finding_limits.jl` - Exploring methods and techniques for calculating limits of functions.
* **Lesson Five:** `an_introduction_to_continuity.jl` - Understanding the concept of continuity and its implications for functions.
* **Lesson Seven:** `the_derivative_and_the_tangent_line_problem.jl` - Introducing the derivative as a slope of a tangent line and its fundamental applications.
* **Lesson Eight:** `basic_differentiation_rules.jl` - Implementing and applying the foundational rules for differentiation.
* **Lesson Nine:** `product_and_quotient_rules.jl` - Mastering differentiation techniques for products and quotients of functions.
* **Lesson Ten:** `the_chain_rule.jl` - Applying the chain rule for differentiating composite functions.
* **Lesson Twelve:** `extrema_on_an_interval.jl` - Identifying absolute and relative extrema of functions over specified intervals.
* **Lesson Thirteen:** `increasing_and_decreasing_functions.jl` - Using the first derivative to determine intervals where a function is increasing or decreasing.
* **Lesson Eighteen:** `antiderivatives_and_basic_integration_rules.jl` - An introduction to antiderivatives and the fundamental rules of indefinite integration.
* **Lesson Nineteen:** `the_area_problem_and_the_definite_integral.jl` - Connecting the concept of the definite integral to the problem of finding the area under a curve.

## Purpose:

These notebooks and scripts are designed to:
* Deepen my theoretical understanding of core Calculus 1 concepts.
* Develop practical computational skills for applying calculus in mathematical modeling using Julia.
* Illustrate numerical and symbolic aspects of calculus.

## Technologies Used:

* **Julia:** All implementations use Julia, leveraging packages such as:
    * `LinearAlgebra.jl`: For any linear algebra operations that may arise.
    * `Symbolics.jl`: For symbolic differentiation, integration, and manipulation.
    * `Latexify.jl`: For rendering mathematical expressions into LaTeX.
    * `Makie.jl` and `CairoMakie.jl`: For creating high-quality static and interactive plots and visualizations.

## How to Navigate This Folder:

Each notebook is organized by topic, demonstrating the concepts and their computational implementation in Julia. You will find code examples, detailed explanations, and practical applications.
