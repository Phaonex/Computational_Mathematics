## Purpose:

These notebooks and scripts are designed to:
* Deepen my theoretical understanding of core Calculus 3 concepts.
* Develop practical computational skills for applying multivariable calculus in mathematical modeling using Julia.
* Illustrate numerical and symbolic aspects of calculus in three or more dimensions.

## Technologies Used:

* **Julia:** All implementations use Julia, leveraging packages such as:
    * `Oscar.jl`: For symbolic computations and algebraic structures.
    * `Symbolics.jl`: For powerful symbolic differentiation, integration, and algebraic manipulation.
    * `Makie.jl` and `CairoMakie.jl`: For creating high-quality 2D and 3D plots and visualizations.
    * `LinearAlgebra.jl`: For fundamental vector and matrix operations inherent in multivariable calculus.
    * `Latexify.jl`: For rendering mathematical expressions into LaTeX, enhancing readability of outputs.

## How to Navigate This Folder:

Each notebook is organized by topic, demonstrating the concepts and their computational implementation in Julia. You will find code examples, detailed explanations, and practical applications.
